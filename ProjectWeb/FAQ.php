        <p>Unfortunately we cannot accept orders through phone at the moment but we are exploring the possibility to do just that in the near future.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, kindly place your order via our website</p><br>

        <h3 style="color:#e84393;">Can i customize my order ?</h3>
        <p>Currently we only offer flower bouquets / arrangements options found on our website. However, we appreciate any suggestions if you if you would like to see type of bouquet or flower being offered in our website. 
            Simply suggest it in the live chat and we will strive to add it to our collection as soon as possible.</p><br>

        <p>You may cancel your order 24 hours or one (1) day before your intended delivery date and we will process a full refund / charge-back to you. 
            Kindly note that refunds will typically take at least ten (10) days for the refund process to be completed depending on the payment method method you used to make your purchase and bank clearance which La Florist does not have influence upon.
           It is your responsibility note of our cancellation policy mentioned above. Failure to do so will deem your request to cancel the order and full refund invalid. </p><br><br>

        <h3 style="color:#e84393;"> How many delivery slots do you have ?</h3>
        <p> We currently offer two (2) delivery slots and they are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM - Order to be placed at least one (1) day in advance</li>

            <b><i>Note: We are unable to provide specific time slots for orders, sorry!</i></b>
        </ol><br>

        <h3 style="color:#e84393;">When will the flowers arrive ?</h3>
        <p>We deliver flowers on any day of the week, including on Sunday. Delivery takes place during business hours until 6:00 PM. 
        <b>If you need flowers to be delivered on Sundays you will need to place your order latest by Saturday 2:30 PM.</b> 
        Please note that we are unable to provide or promise an exact time of delivery but be rest assured that our delivery routes will be planned with efficiency in mind.</p><br>

        <h3 style="color:#e84393;">How will the flowers arrive ?</h3>
        <p>Our flowers are delivered by drivers and riders that are experienced in transporting delicate goods - flowers. 
            Therefore, we know how to make sure that the flowers will arrive just like the florist has designed them.</p><br>

        <h3 style="color:#e84393;">Can i pick up the flowers myself ?</h3>
        <p>No, unfortunately not. We deliver 100% of our orders and do not operate a storefront business. 
            However, we will consider and review these requests on a case-by-case basis. Kindly contact our customer support hotline 03-1234 5678 (Mon-Sun, 9:00 AM-6:00 PM) to clarify before placing your order.</p><br>

        <h3 style="color:#e84393;">Can you ensure that you hand over the flowers directly to my recipient ?</h3>
         <p>As much as we would like to, we are not always able to. Should the recipient be unavailable at the time of delivery, we will pass the flowers to a receptionist, colleague, family member, friend or security guard post. 
             Sometimes, due to some security policies imposed by certain residences, office buildings, and companies our rider will not be allowed in but to call for the recipient to collect the flowers themselves.</p><br>
